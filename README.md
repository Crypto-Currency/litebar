#LiteBar (LTB) - a fork of Litecoin (LTC)
##The silver equivalence of BitBar with fast block time and fast confirmations (only 4 confirmations needed).
<br>
<br>
* 3 minutes block target
* 4 transactions to confirm
* Transaction fee = 0.001
* Uses scrypt as Proof of Work (PoW) Scheme
* Difficulty retargets once per block (Using Kimoto Gravity Well)
* Total litebars rewarded = 1350000 (1.35M) only. This is a rare bar!
* Linear designed litebar production (reward will halve once only to a minimum reward of 1 litebar)
* Litebar generation process will last for 5 years only after which it will lay in a state of perpetuity (2014-2019)
* First 7200 starting blocks (15 days) will have 5 litebars per block Hereafter it will drop to 2 litebars per block and /2 once after 2.5 years (or 438000 blocks)
* The default ports are 9065 (connect) and 9055 (json rpc).
